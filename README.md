# Player Template


## 1. Quick Start Checklist

1. **Copy the template** – Fork this repository into your own GitHub account if you want the automated player to run. You can clone first to experiment locally, but GitHub Actions only executes in your fork.
2. **Add repository secrets** – In **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** create:
   - `PLAYER_NAME` – the public name you want the server to display.
   - `SERVER_URL` – the base UBX server URL.
   - `GAME_TOKEN` – a fine-grained GitHub token with `Actions` and `Workflows` read/write scopes.

## 2. Registration

Run `.github/workflows/register.yml` from the Actions.

## 3. What the scripts do

- `register.py` validates secrets, reads `PLAYER_NAME` from the environment, posts `{ "player_name": PLAYER_NAME }` to `/register`, and logs the result. 
- `strategy.py` fetches `/status`, builds an action, and posts it back via `/action`. Customise it by editing `strategy(state)` to pick `shoot`/`keep` directions based on the state. The `strategy()` function must return the same dictionary described below.

## 4. Understanding the `/status` payload

`/status` responds with a JSON dictionary—`{}` at the very beginning of a fresh game—that contains:

- `playerIds`: every registered player ID (these are what you target in your action maps).
- `myPlayerId`: the ID associated with your GitHub token.
- `opponentsIds`: convenience list of all other IDs.
- `state`: a list where each entry records one completed turn. Penalty shootout rounds look like:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "_turnId": 1,
      "player-id-A": {
        "shoot": { "player-id-B": 2 },
        "keep":  { "player-id-B": 0 },
        "outcome": { "player-id-B": { "goal": 1 } }
      },
      "player-id-B": {
        "shoot": { "player-id-A": 1 },
        "keep":  { "player-id-A": 2 },
        "outcome": { "player-id-A": { "goal": 0 } }
      }
    },
    {
      "_turnId": 2,
      "...": { "...": "..." }
    }
  ]
  ```
- `turnId`, `registrationPhase`, `gamePhase`: metadata describing where the match is.

Store or inspect this data to drive smarter strategies.

## 5. Building the action payload

Your `strategy(state)` function must return a dictionary with two maps, one for shooting and one for keeping. For example:

```json
{
  "shoot": { "player-id-A": 2, "player-id-B": 1 },
  "keep":  { "player-id-A": 0, "player-id-B": 2 }
}
```

- `shoot` lists the direction (integers `0`, `1`, or `2`) you will shoot against each opponent.
- `keep` lists the direction you will guard against each opponent.
- Opponent IDs come straight from `playerIds`/`opponentsIds` in the `/status` payload.

Example: if the server identifies you as `"player-A"` and you face opponents `"player-B"` and `"player-C"`, one admissible return value is

```json
{
  "shoot": { "player-B": 2, "player-C": 0 },
  "keep":  { "player-B": 1, "player-C": 1 }
}
```

`main()` already turns this dictionary into the HTTP payload, so you do not need to worry about the outer structure—just return the maps above.
